- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs: 
- WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
